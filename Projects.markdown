Here I am going to show you my past projects.

### Floating-Point Hardware Acceleration using FPGA
#### **Jan. 2021 - Apr. 2021**
---   

* Cooperated with teammate to produce custom hardware acceleration for floating-point (IEEE-754) arithmetic.
* Designed in Quartus and implemented on Intel Cyclone V FPGA.
* PL design done using Verilog to write floating-point adders and multipliers from scratch for best performance.
* Constructed the CORDIC algorithm for quick approximation of Cosine in hardware.
* Implemented NIOS II soft CPU on FPGA and programmed using C/C++ in Eclipse Mars.
* Achieved up to 92% better performance than using software.


### Property Price Predictor
#### **Nov. 2020**
---   

* Collaborated in a team to design a Machine Learning model that predicts house prices.
* Coded in Python inside Jupyter notebook and utilised Pytorch to create a Neural Network for training.
* Used Numpy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn to handle data and pre-processing.
* Trained on dataset of Californian property prices from the U.S. Census Bureau.
* Achieved 0.0137 Mean-Squared-Error on held out data after training and hyper-parameter tuning using Cross-Validation.
* Awarded grade A.

### C-Compiler
#### **Feb. 2020 - Apr. 2020**
---     

* Worked with partner to build compiler that turns C into Assembly.
* Implemented a translation feature that could turn C to Python.
* Written in C++ and utilised Flex and Bison for lexing and parsing.
* Strong use of Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.
* GitHub and good time management simplified working remotely.
* Accomplished efficient compilation to MIPS Assembly that could link with Gcc output.
